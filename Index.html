    <!-- how does website work -->
    <p>
        The web is a vast network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other to deliver information and services to users. 
        In software development, understanding how the web works is essential, as it forms the foundation for building web applications and services. 
        Here's a high-level overview of how the web works in software development:

Client and Server Architecture:

The web operates on a client-server architecture. Clients are typically web browsers, mobile apps, or any device capable of making HTTP requests. 
Servers are computers that store and manage web content and services.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL):

A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the web. 
It consists of a protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), domain name (e.g., www.example.com), and path to the resource (e.g., /page.html).

HTTP and HTTPS:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. 
It defines how requests and responses should be formatted and sent between clients and servers. 
HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data to protect it from eavesdropping and tampering.

Request-Response Cycle:

When a user enters a URL in their browser or interacts with a web application, the client sends an HTTP request to the server specified in the URL.
The server processes the request, which may involve querying databases, executing code, or retrieving files.
The server sends an HTTP response back to the client, which contains the requested content or information.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure web content, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and layout of web pages, including fonts, colors, and spacing.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic behavior on web pages, allowing developers to create responsive and feature-rich web applications.

Web Servers and Hosting:

Web servers are specialized software or hardware that handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and send out responses. Common web server software includes Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.
Websites and web applications are hosted on web servers or cloud platforms, making them accessible to users worldwide.

DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand. This enables users to access websites using friendly domain names instead of numeric IP addresses.

Web APIs:

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data over the web. 
They enable developers to integrate external services and data into their applications.

Web Security:

Web security practices, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and input validation, are crucial to protect user data and ensure the integrity of web applications.

Web Standards and Protocols:

Web development relies on various standards and protocols, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ECMAScript, HTTP/HTTPS, and more, to ensure compatibility and interoperability across different browsers and devices.
